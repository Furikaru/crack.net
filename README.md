# CRACK.NET CAN ONLY BE USED FOR WINDOWS! I have absolutely NO reponsibillity that when using Crack.NET something can go wrong with your computer.
Even though it is almost literally impossible for anything to happen like this while using the application, if something goes wrong, it is not my reponsibillity. It is yours, so if you don't agree to this, don't download the application.
If you would like to use the application without this happening just stick to the main releases. Don't download the pre-release versions, or, use at your own risk.

Crack.NET does NOT support Unix based platforms or any other operating system differring from Microsoft Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10 and 11.
Crack.NET also possibly works with Windows Vista and XP.
